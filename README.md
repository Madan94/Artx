Artx - Blockchain Based Art Selling Web App to ensure the authenticity and tracking of art works.

This Project is done by me during the HACK7DAYS Blockchain Hackathon conducted by Tezos India in associated with Chennai Institute of Technology.

Artx is a blockchain-based art sales platform that leverages decentralized ledger technology to ensure the authenticity and provenance tracking of artworks. It enables artists to tokenize their art, creating a unique digital representation of each piece, and facilitates transparent, secure transactions using smart contracts.
